# ⚠️API IS NOW OFFLINE⚠️
GCP Container Registry will be phased out starting May 2024, so I've made the decision to shut down the API now in May 2023.

# Bloody API
Want to spice up your sentences by inserting "bloody" in an appropriate manner? This is the perfect API for you!

# Why?
Something something *portfolio* something something *please hire me*.

# Does it actually work?
Yes! But it's made as a joke, so don't rely on this for anything important. If you can actually think of a commerical use case for this, I'd love to hear about it.
